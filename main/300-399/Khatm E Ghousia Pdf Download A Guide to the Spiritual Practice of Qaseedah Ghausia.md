# Khatm E Ghousia: A Spiritual Practice of Reciting Qaseedah Ghausia
 
Khatm E Ghousia is a spiritual practice of reciting Qaseedah Ghausia, a poem composed by the great Sufi saint Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra). Qaseedah Ghausia is a praise of Allah and His Messenger (saw), as well as a supplication for divine blessings and guidance. It also contains secrets of gnosis and spiritual elevation.
 
Qaseedah Ghausia is divided into 11 stanzas, each with its own virtues and benefits. According to some sources, reciting Qaseedah Ghausia 11 times daily can bring one closer to Allah and His beloved Prophet (saw), as well as grant one the vision of Allah and His awliya (friends). Reciting Qaseedah Ghausia with specific intentions can also help one achieve one's worldly and spiritual goals, such as gaining knowledge, wealth, health, love, protection, etc.

Khatm E Ghousia is usually performed in a group or majlis, with a leader who recites the Qaseedah aloud and the followers who repeat after him. Before and after the recitation, Durood Shareef (salutations upon the Prophet) and Fateha (opening chapter of the Quran) are offered for the Prophet (saw), Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra) and all the masters of the Qadiriyya order. The recitation is done with respect, devotion and concentration, while facing the Qibla (direction of Kaaba).
 
Khatm E Ghousia can be done at any time, but preferably after Esha or Tahajjud prayers. It is recommended to avoid eating meat, chicken, eggs and other jalaali (hot) foods before the recitation. One should also be in a state of purity and wear clean clothes. One should also make tasawwur (visualization) of one's Sheikh or spiritual guide during the recitation.
 
Khatm E Ghousia is a powerful way of connecting with Allah and His Messenger (saw), as well as receiving the blessings and intercession of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra) and his successors. It is a means of purifying one's heart, mind and soul, and attaining spiritual enlightenment and bliss.
